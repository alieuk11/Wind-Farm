# Wind-Farm
This program uses several constraints in order to evaluate the most ideal location for a proposed wind farm. In the first .m file, there are 5 return values which are used to determine whether or not the proposed location passes all of the given constraints. The next .m file is used to create a figure with multiple plots that summarize the environmental conditions of the wind farm.
